{"content": "Your body cannot tell the difference between a lion and a criticism.\n\nWhen cortisol floods your system, it arrives with the same ancient logic: something threatens you. The hormone evolved to mobilize survival — to sharpen focus, tense muscles, prepare flight or fight. It responds to danger. But danger, to your nervous system, doesn’t require teeth or claws. It only requires a story about being threatened.\n\nThat story is victimhood.\n\nWhat happens when you feel victimized. Someone dismisses your idea in a meeting. A partner forgets an important date. A friend cancels plans. The content varies, but the physiology remains remarkably consistent: chest tightens, jaw clenches, heart accelerates. Cortisol rises. Your body believes you’re under attack because your mind has interpreted events through the lens of threat — something is happening to me against my will.\n\nThis is where the mechanism reveals itself. Cortisol doesn’t release because events harm you. It releases because you’ve constructed yourself as a separate entity that can be harmed. The victim isn’t created by circumstances. The victim is the interpretive framework that converts experience into assault.\n\nConsider: when a lion appears on the savanna, cortisol serves survival. The danger is physical, immediate, unambiguous. But when your colleague receives the promotion you wanted, no actual predator exists. Yet cortisol flows just the same. Why? Because you’ve created a psychological predator — an event that threatens not your body, but your sense of self. Your identity as worthy, as chosen, as special. The hormone responds to the constructed threat as if it were real.\n\nThe feeling of being a victim is the feeling of cortisol in motion. They arrive together, inseparable. You cannot feel victimized without stress hormones, and stress hormones cannot flow without some version of “this shouldn’t be happening to me.” The chemistry and the narrative are two descriptions of the same event.\n\nvictimhood isn’t weakness or moral failing. It’s an ancient survival mechanism misapplied. Your body, magnificent and precise, still operates on the assumption that threats are physical. When you interpret psychological events as dangers — when someone’s opinion becomes an attack, when disappointment becomes catastrophe — your physiology responds accordingly. Cortisol rises. Fight or flight activates. You become, biochemically, a prey animal.\n\nBut notice: the victim requires a victimizer. The threatened self requires something threatening it. This construction depends entirely on identification with a separate entity that can be harmed. When you believe you are a discrete, vulnerable self navigating a hostile world, every unexpected event becomes a potential attack. Every criticism threatens your worth. Every rejection confirms your inadequacy. The story generates the chemistry; the chemistry reinforces the story.\n\nWhat happens if you don’t take the bait?\n\nAwareness watches cortisol rise without claiming ownership. The sensation appears — heat in the chest, tightness in the throat — but it isn’t happening to you. It’s simply happening. Stress hormones are patterns moving through consciousness, nothing more. They carry information about how the nervous system has interpreted events, but they are not evidence that the interpretation is accurate. You can feel the chemistry without believing the story it tells.\n\nThis doesn’t mean denying emotion or suppressing response. The body’s reactions are real. Cortisol is measurable, observable, undeniable. But the feeling of being victimized — the narrative overlay that says “this is being done to me” — that part is optional. It’s an interpretation, not a fact. When you see this distinction clearly, something shifts. The chemistry still moves through, but it moves through emptiness rather than through a self that can be threatened.\n\nVictimhood dissolves not through thinking better thoughts, but through recognizing what’s actually happening. Cortisol flows. Stories arise. Neither defines you. You are the space in which both appear, the awareness that contains stress hormones and interpretations without becoming either one. From that perspective, nothing is happening to anyone. It’s all just happening.\n\nThe threatened self was never real. It was a conclusion your nervous system drew, a pattern your conditioning reinforced, a story cortisol learned to tell. When you stop believing it, the chemistry still comes and goes — life continues to move through stress and ease — but you’re no longer its victim.\n\nYou’re just the space where it all unfolds."}
